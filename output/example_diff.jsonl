Perhaps he came up with the tunnel project so that he could offer people jobs. （那时候很多人都失业了，而威廉姆森是出了名的善良。也许他提出地道工程是为了给人们提供工作。）\" 说明威廉姆森建地道的其中一个原因可能是为了帮助别人。E项 \"其中一个想法是，富有的威廉姆森试图帮助他人。\" 中的to help others （帮助他人）与下文一致。故选E项。 【小题4】上文 \"Perhaps he was afraid that some type of dangerous event would happen.（也许他是害怕会发生什么危险的事情。）\" 说明他建地道或许是出于安全考虑，以保护自己。G项 \"地道可以保护他和他所爱的人。\" 与上文一致。故选G项。 【小题5】下文 \"Williamson did not tell many people why he built the tunnels.（威廉姆森没有告诉很多人他建造地道的原因。）\" 和 \"For now, the mystery of the Williams on Tunnels remains.（目前，威廉姆斯家族关于地道的谜团仍然存在。）\" 说明他建地道的原因依然都是猜测，真正的原因并没有人知道。B项 \"这些想法很有趣，但没有人知道真相。\" no one knows the truth（没有人知道真实情况）与下文内容一致。故选B项。", "hard_level": "0.2", "keypoint": [{"国标体系🆗": {"考纲话题🆗": {}, "考纲话题": {"历史、社会与文化🆗": {"政治、历史事件与文化渊源🆗": {}, "政治、历史事件与文化渊源": {}}, "历史、社会与文化": {}}, "题型话题🆗": {}, "题型话题": {"完形填空🆗": {"历史与地理🆗": {}, "历史与地理": {}}, "完形填空": {}}, "题型🆗": {}, "题型": {"信息匹配🆗": {}, "信息匹配": {}}, "能力🆗": {}, "能力": {"读🆗": {}, "读": {}}}, "国标体系": {}}], "data_format": "text", "grade_class": "k12", "area": "", "grade": "2021~2022学年北京东城区高一下学期期末英语试卷", "img_list": {}, "language": "chinese", "major": "英语", "supplier": "KSJ_XES", "type_class": "套题", "exam_type": "", "year": "", "raw_id": "", "raw_file": "", "used_flag": true, "missing_parts": [], "drop_reason": [], "content": "Walking Under Liverpool In most ways, the English city of Liverpool is no different from other large cities.
